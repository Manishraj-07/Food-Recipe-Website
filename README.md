# Food Recipe Website

## Overview
This project is a dynamic Food Recipe Website built using React.js for the frontend and Node.js/Express for the backend. It allows users to search for food recipes using a simple and intuitive interface. The application connects to a recipe API through the backend server to fetch and display detailed recipe information.

## Features
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for recipes by entering keywords in the search box
- **Responsive Design**: The interface adapts smoothly to different screen sizes
- **Recipe Cards**: Each recipe is displayed in an attractive card format with hover animations
- **Detailed View**: Clicking on a recipe card opens a modal with complete ingredients, instructions, and a YouTube link
- **User Feedback**: Displays "No recipes found" message when search yields no results

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React JS, CSS3, HTML5
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **API**: TheMealDB API for recipe data
- **HTTP Client**: Axios for API requests

## Application Structure
- **Assets**: Contain Screenshots of the Homepage and Recipes
- **Frontend**: Contains React components, styling, and user interface logic
- **Backend**: Express server that handles API requests and data formatting
